# Ubilinux Setup File

#
# This file, when executed, will (attempt to) completely configure
# an Intel Edison running Ubilinux for running the quadrotor program.
# While it's designed to be run all at once, it may be helpful to run
# one line at a time to make sure everything works, in which case this
# file mostly serves as a checklist/set of instructions for everything
# you need to do. 
#
# To execute this file, change the execution permissions of this file
# (chmod +x ./ubilinuxSetup) and run it (./ubilinuxSetup). It should be
# that simple.
#
# An internet connection is required for this process. However, seeing
# as how you needed an internet connection to download this file from
# GitHub, that shouldn't be an issue.


# Updates applications first
apt-get update

# Do it again to make sure everything's truly up to date
apt-get update


# Gets NPT (used to update the clock)
apt-get install ntp


# Installs OpenCV
apt-get install libopencv-dev


# Sets up some necessary libraries
cd ./lib/
chmod +x setupLibraries
./setupLibraries
cd ../


# Sets up GLPK (used for finding optimal yaw values)
# Makes everything executable, configures the installation,
# performs initial compilation, checks compilation, and finally installs
cd ./lib/glpk-4.55/
chmod -R +x ./*
./configure
make
make check
make install
cd ../..
ldconfig


# Cleans up the GLPK installation process
git checkout -- lib/glpk-4.55
