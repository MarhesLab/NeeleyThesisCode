Logfile Format Changelog

*** Version 3.0 (6/15/2015) ***
- Started recording state reference values
	(13 values, right after IMU values)
- Started recording state trajectory values
	(18 values, right after reference values)


*** Version 2.0 (5/23/2015) ***
- Switched from using Euler angles to using quaternions
- Increased state values size by 1 (see above)
- Increased vicon values size by 1 (see above)
- Started recording measured motor RPMs from Autopilot
	(4 values, right after DMC characters)



*** Version 1.0 (3/15/2015) ***
- Started recording changes to the quadrotor's log file format
- Current Order:
	- 1  value: 	Time since logging started (seconds)
	- 12 values: 	Quadrotor states (position, velocity, angles, angular velocities)
	- 6  values:	Vicon measurements (positions, angles)
	- 6  values: 	IMU measurements (angular velocities, linear accelerations)
	- 4  values: 	Commanded inputs (thrust and torques)
	- 4  values: 	Actual inputs (thrust and torques)
	- 4  values: 	Motor Rotation Speeds (rad/s)
	- 4  values: 	Direct Motor Command (DMC) characters
	- 2  values:	Current and Desired flight modes (see mode definitions in "../defs.h")
