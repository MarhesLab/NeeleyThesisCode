NOTE: by default, there are no API methods to get the number of iterations executed. The files in "GLPK_Headers" are used to figure out the structure of the "glpk_prob" structure so the iteration count can be pulled out directly (problem->it_cnt)

ANOTHER NOTE: By default, the interior-point method doesn't even keep track of the iterations at all. To bypass this, two functions were modified to update problem->it_cnt: 
- "glpipm.c", in "ipm_solve": 
	add in the line "P->it_cnt = csa->iter;" after "ret = ipm_main(csa);"
- "glpapi08.c", in "glp_interior":
	addin the following lines after "ret = ipm_solve(prob, parm);"

	  int iters;
	  iters = prob->it_cnt;
	  P->it_cnt = iters;
