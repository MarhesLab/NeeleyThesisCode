# Ubuntu Setup File
# By: Wil Neeley
# July 5th, 2015
#
# This file, when executed, will (attempt to) completely configure
# a computer running Ubuntu for compiling/testing the quadrotor program.
# While it's designed to be run all at once, it may be helpful to run
# one line at a time to make sure everything works, in which case this
# file mostly serves as a checklist/set of instructions for everything
# you need to do. 
#
# To execute this file, change the execution permissions of this file
# (chmod +x ./ubilinuxSetup) and run it (./ubilinuxSetup). It should be
# that simple.
#
# To execute one line at a time, copy (ctrl + c) a line out of here and
# paste (ctrl + shift + v) it into a terminal. Hit enter to run it.
#
# An internet connection is required for this process. However, seeing
# as how you needed an internet connection to download this file from
# GitHub, that shouldn't be an issue.


# Updates applications first
sudo apt-get update


# Allows universal repositories
sudo add-apt-repository universe


# Sets up serial port configuration
sudo apt-get install screen
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER


# Installs various essential/useful applications
# build-essential: gets things associated with compiling code
# ubuntu-restricted-extras: for playing back music/media
# vim: a good command line text editor. Learn it. Love it.
# nautilus-open-terminal: lets you right click in a folder and open the terminal there.
# dfu-util: used for flashing the OS onto the Intel Edison
sudo apt-get install build-essential ubuntu-restricted-extras vim nautilus-open-terminal dfu-util

# Resets Nautilus (the file/folder explorer) to load nautilus-open-terminal
nautilus -q 


# Installs OpenCV
sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev


# Sets up necessary libraries
cd ./lib
sudo ./setupLibraries
cd ../


# Sets up GLPK (used for finding optimal yaw values)
# Makes everything executable, configures the installation,
# performs initial compilation, checks compilation, and finally installs
cd ./opt/glpk-4.55/
chmod -R +x ./*
./configure
make
make check
make install
cd ../..


# Cleans up the GLPK installation process
git checkout -- opt/glpk-4.55
